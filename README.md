# Visionary School API Project


FastAPI is a super fast Python framework that allows developers to build APIs. To serve the API it uses Uvicorn which is a fast ASGI-server. While working on this repo, I was able to learn about ways to interact with the API using SwaggerUI which is built within the FastAPI framework.

Learning more about the web servers Uvicorn & Hypercorn.
